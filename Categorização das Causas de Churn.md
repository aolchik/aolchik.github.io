Abaixo as possíveis causas de churn segundo David Skok:

1) Produto não atende expectativas

  You are not meeting your customers expectations.
  - The product may not provide enough value
  - Instability or bugginess

2) Produto não é lembrado

  Your product is not sticky. It might provide some value in the first few months, and then once the customer has that value, they may feel they don’t need to keep paying. To make your product sticky, try making it a key part of their monthly workflow, and/or have them store data in your product that is highly valuable to them, where the value would be lost of they cancelled.

3) Cliente não foi ativado

  You have not successfully got the customer’s users to adopt the product. Or they may not be using certain of the key sticky features in the product.

4) Venda inflada

   Your sales force may have oversold the product, or sold it to a customer that is not well suited to get the benefits

5) Descontinuidade negócio/operação

  You may be selling to SMB’s where a lot of them go out of business. It isn’t enough that what you’re selling is sticky. Who you’re selling it to must also be sticky.

6) Precificação assimétrica - não necessariamente causa do churn, mas impacta net revenue churn.

  You are not using a pricing scheme that helps drive expansion bookings
